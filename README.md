# Asset-Allocation
Backgroud
Our client is a highly-respected large cap company which has a significant sum of assets in their corporate pension, and would like one component of their pension assets to be invested in a fixed-maturity multi-asset scheme with a regular payout.

The main characteristics of this special portion of pension are the following:

All assets will be given back to the retirees in 10 years
The initial investment is €120M, and each month, the payout should be MAX(€1.001M,P), where P is the 1/n fraction of total remaining assets each month, where n is the number of remaining months to the maturity (i.e. 1/120 for the first payout and 1/119 for the second etc)
It is in the retiree’s interest to maximise P
If the remaining total assets become less than €1.001M, however, this company is liable to meet the shortfall
Your report should include the elements listed below:
